# VSCode Flavors

VSCode without a doubt it's an amazing tool, but for me, is missing an important setting to enable/disable extensions depending on language or workspace.

Almost me, jump all day between projects in different languages and I have a lot of extensions and settings that are useless in each scenario consuming resources. You can disable it manually on each project, but if you create a new one, you gonna need to make it all again. That's a waste of time.

While the VSCode team solves that, we can use a little workaround, creating our dedicated profile for each type of development.
